# Admin Stats API Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **totalInvestment** - Now Only Counts Active Bots
**Before**: Counted investment from all bots (active + stopped + paused)
**After**: Only counts investment from active bots
```javascript
// OLD
const totalInvestment = allBots.reduce((sum, bot) => sum + (bot.config.investmentAmount || 0), 0);

// NEW
const totalInvestment = activeBotsList.reduce((sum, bot) => sum + (bot.config.investmentAmount || 0), 0);
```

### 2. **activeBotsInvestment** - Now Counts Only Executed Buy Orders Value
**Before**: Counted total configured investment amount for active bots
**After**: Counts actual value of executed buy orders (real money invested)
```javascript
// NEW Logic
if (analysis.currentPositions && analysis.currentPositions.holdings) {
  for (const holding of analysis.currentPositions.holdings) {
    activeBotsInvestment += holding.quantity * holding.avgPrice;
  }
}
```

### 3. **totalUnrealizedProfit** - Fixed Calculation
**Before**: Included unrealized profit from stopped bots (which shouldn't have unrealized positions)
**After**: Only counts unrealized profit from active bots
```javascript
// NEW Logic
if (bot.status === 'active') {
  totalUnrealizedProfit += analysis.profitLossAnalysis.unrealizedPnL || 0;
}
```

### 4. **totalProfit** - Now Includes Both Active and Stopped Bots
**Before**: Only counted profit from active bots
**After**: Includes realized profit from all bots (active + stopped) + unrealized profit from active bots
```javascript
// NEW Logic - processes ALL bots
for (const bot of allBots) {
  // Include realized profit from both active and stopped bots
  totalRealizedProfit += analysis.profitLossAnalysis.realizedPnL || 0;
  
  // Only include unrealized profit from active bots
  if (bot.status === 'active') {
    totalUnrealizedProfit += analysis.profitLossAnalysis.unrealizedPnL || 0;
  }
}
```

## Additional Fixes in GridBotService

### 5. **calculateCurrentHoldings** - Use Executed Prices
**Before**: Used order.price for cost calculations
**After**: Uses order.executedPrice || order.price for accurate calculations
```javascript
// NEW
const executedQty = order.executedQty || order.quantity;
const executedPrice = order.executedPrice || order.price;
totalCost += executedQty * executedPrice;
```

### 6. **Realized PnL Calculation** - Use Executed Prices
**Before**: Used order.price for profit calculations
**After**: Uses order.executedPrice || order.price for accurate profit calculations
```javascript
// NEW
const buyPrice = pair.buyOrder.executedPrice || pair.buyOrder.price;
const sellPrice = pair.sellOrder.executedPrice || pair.sellOrder.price;
const profit = (sellPrice - buyPrice) * tradeQty;
```

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the API response will now show:

1. **totalInvestment**: Only investment from active bots
2. **activeBotsInvestment**: Actual money invested in executed buy orders
3. **totalUnrealizedProfit**: Unrealized profit from active bots only
4. **totalProfit**: Combined profit from all bots (active + stopped)

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
node test_admin_stats_fix.js
```

The test will show detailed calculations and verify that the changes work correctly.

## Debug Logs

Added console.log statements to track calculations:
- Shows processing of each bot
- Displays realized and unrealized profit per bot
- Shows active investment calculations
- Provides final calculation summary

These logs will help identify any remaining issues and can be removed in production.
